    <p class="card-body">
      Chai is undergoing
      <span class="font-medium text-green-400">significant upgrades</span> to
      enhance functionality! I'm revamping its backend tools, particularly
      focusing on image generation, utilizing Rust for improved performance.
      Additionally, Chai will soon
      <span class="font-medium text-green-400">boast a suite of new features</span>. Expect convenient commands to
      monitor your monthly spending within the
      game, along with alerts when expenditures approach preset limits.
      Furthermore, Chai will enable in-game purchases directly through Discord,
      making Fortnite purchases much easier. Chai will soon keep you informed
      about Fortnite item shop updates, ensuring you never miss out on
      sought-after items. These enhancements aim to
      <span class="font-medium text-green-400">elevate your Fortnite experience</span>, providing seamless integration
      and timely notifications.
