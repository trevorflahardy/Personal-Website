				I'm currently a student at the <span class="text-emerald-400">University of South
					Florida</span> for my Bachelor's in Computer Science. I've always been into tech, but
				as I grew into who I am today I now see the remarkable difference I can have in peoples lives through
				what I
				love. For me, it's
				not about usersâ€”it's about people. Every person who interacts with what I
				build has a story, and I create with that in mind. I'm driven by the idea that tech should serve, not
				just function, because technology without people is meaningless.
