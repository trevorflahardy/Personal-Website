      for my Bachelor's in Computer Science. Tech has always been a part of my
      life, but as I've grown, I've come to realize the meaningful impact it can
      have on people's lives. For me, it's not just about users—it's about real
      people with real stories. I create with that in mind, driven by the idea
      that tech should serve, not just function. After all, technology without
      people is meaningless.

      What Makes me Tick
    </h3>
    <p class="text-gray-200">
      When I'm not buried in a project or deep in academics, I'm probably under
      the hood of a car, playing pickleball, or pushing myself at the gym.
      Growing up, I was always drawn to helping others, and discovering
      programming felt like a natural way to extend that. I know it sounds
      cliché, but this isn't just a hobby—it's woven into who I am.
      <br /><br />
      Programming is my way of life, a labor of love, and I'm constantly looking
      for ways to use it to make a real impact. One day, I hope to work at
      Apple, particularly on the Apple Watch team. Their approach to creating
      tech that genuinely enhances lives aligns with my values, and I see it as
      the ultimate intersection of technology and human connection.
