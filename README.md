# Personal Website

View the website on [Github Pages](https://trevorflahardy.github.io/Personal-Website/) if you'd like!

This is a background project of mine to get a personal website running for internship applications in the near future. This is a work in progress, basically everything is subject to change - but the main idea is that the website is going to be centered around mimicking Apple's VisionOS within a web application, which I thought was a nifty idea.

## Progress Tracking

I'm keeping track of my progress as I continue to work on my website. Here are some previous versions as I figure out what I want and what I like. The version tracking is from newest to oldest.

### Version 3
September 21st, 2024: I'm dubbing Version 3 of this project; I feel it's changed enough to constitute a progress update. I still have hopes for the following, which I plan to address in the coming update
- [ ] More content on the profile page, like hobbies, education, achievements, and _why_ my personal website looks as it does.
- [ ] A cleaner Docuflow page which has the name of "Docuflow" in the title perhaps
- [ ] A cleaner Chai introduction which has some better branding elements
- [ ]
