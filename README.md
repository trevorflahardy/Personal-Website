# Personal Website

View the website on [Github Pages](https://trevorflahardy.github.io/Personal-Website/) if you'd like!

This is a background project of mine to get a personal website running for internship applications in the near future. This is a work in progress, basically everything is subject to change - but the main idea is that the website is going to be centered around mimicking Apple's VisionOS within a web application, which I thought was a nifty idea.
