# Personal Website

This is a backrgound project of mine to get a personal website running for internship applications in gthe near future. This is a work in progress, basically everything is subject to change - but the main idea is that the website is going to be centered around mimicing Apple's VisionOS within a web application, which I thought was a nifty idea. Here's a preview of what I have:
